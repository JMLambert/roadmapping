###Reference Files

* [Use Case document](https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/roadmapping/blob/UseCaseDoc/UseCases.md)  
* Mind Map Notes [PDF](RoadmappingNotes2014_4_30.pdf) | [MindNode Binary](RoadmappingNotes.mindnode)

###Meeting Notes

* Discussed progress on roamdmapping process:
    * We have a good start on a set of application needs
    * Needs discussion has been translated into [Use Cases](https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/roadmapping/blob/UseCaseDoc/UseCases.md)
    * Use Cases include a high level description, success criteria (application requirements), and technology areas
    * Next steps include:
        1. Finalize needs Elicitation
        2. Review Use Cases for correctness, accuracy, completeness
        3. Generate technology areas for each use case, preferably with quantified performance specifications
        4. Compile and categorize the technology areas
        5. Review current technologies and identify gaps
        6. Prioritize and schedule future efforts
* New Machine Interfaces:
	* A ROS enhancement proposal (REP) has been drafted for controlling robot I/O through ROS-I
	* The REP has been [drafted](https://github.com/gavanderhoorn/rep-ros-i/blob/rep-xxxx_generic_io/rep-ixxxx.rst) and will be coordinated by [Gijs van der Hoorn](mailto:g.a.vanderhoorn@tudelft.nl) at [TU Delft](http://robotics.tudelft.nl)
* New application discussions:
    * Additive manufacturing from CAD
    * Robotic NC control - CAM Interfaces
    * Interfacing with CAD models, simulations, or optimization products that include process and quality specifications
    * Need for generalized process optimization framework

###Action Items

* Review [use case document](https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/roadmapping/blob/UseCaseDoc/UseCases.md) and provide feedback - All
* Update use cases with photos of notes and discussion from 4/30 - Clay

###Next Meeting

Tuesday, May 20 12:00 Central to coordinate with [ROS-I Training](http://rosindustrial.org/events/2014/5/19/ros-i-developers-training-class)
